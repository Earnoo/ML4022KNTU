## Course Project

- [Mini project 1](https://github.com/Earnoo/ML4022KNTU/tree/main/Mini%20project%201)
  
  This repository provides an overview of Logistic Regression, essential preprocessing techniques, and how to use the Orange application for data mining and classification tasks. Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification problems. Preprocessing is crucial to ensure the quality of data and improve the performance of machine learning models. Orange is a powerful tool for visual programming in data mining.
- [Mini project 2](https://github.com/Earnoo/ML4022KNTU/tree/main/Mini%20project%202)
  
  This project is divided into four main parts, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning, data preprocessing, and visualization.
- [Mini project 3](https://github.com/Earnoo/ML4022KNTU/tree/main/Mini%20project%203)

  This repository contains two main parts:
  
  1. Visualization and classification of the Iris dataset using PCA, t-SNE, and SVM.
  2. Credit card fraud detection using SMOTE, Autoencoders, and Neural Networks.
   
- [Mini project 4 (DDQN vs DQN on lunarlander)](https://github.com/Earnoo/ML4022KNTU/tree/main/DDQN-DQN-on-lunarlander)
  
The goal of this project is to train an AI agent to achieve an average score of over 200 points per episode in the Lunar Lander game using reinforcement learning techniques.
