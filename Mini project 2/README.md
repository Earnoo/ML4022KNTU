# McCulloch-Pitts Neuron, Bearing Fault Dataset Analysis, Drug Classification, and Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project is divided into four main parts, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning, data preprocessing, and visualization.

## Part 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neuron Visualization

In this part, we visualize the outputs of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model applied to a set of data points. The model's decision boundaries are illustrated using different activation functions, including threshold, sigmoid, tanh, and relu. This helps in understanding how different activation functions influence the model's behavior and classification.

## Part 2: CWRU Bearing Fault Dataset Analysis

The second part involves analyzing the [CWRU Bearing fault](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file) dataset. We preprocess the data, extract statistical features, and implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for classification. The MLP's architecture and training process are detailed, including performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Part 3: Drug Classification Using Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

This part focuses on classifying drug types based on patient features from the [drug200](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees) dataset. We preprocess the data, encode categorical features, and implement various models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. The models' performances are evaluated and visualized using confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Part 4: Heart Disease Prediction Using Naive Bayes

The final part deals with predicting heart disease using the [heart](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) dataset. The data is preprocessed, scaled, and split into training and testing sets. We implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict heart disease presence, evaluating its performance with confusion matrices, classification reports, and accuracy scores. Additionally, a sample of predictions is analyzed for correctness.
